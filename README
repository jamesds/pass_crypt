PASS_CRYPT


* Introduction *
A simple application written in Ruby that allows the secure storage and retrieval of usernames and passwords.  Usernames and passwords are stored in an SQLite database, encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption with a personal passphrase and random salt.  When fetched, the password is copied into the clipboard for use, and replaced with the original contents after 10 seconds.  This ensures the security of the password since it does not make an appearance in the terminal and thus will not be saved in any logs.  When storing a username and password there is the option of entering the password manually, or taking it from the clipboard.


* Requirements *
clipboard (gem)
$ gem install clipboard # may require sudo

xclip & libsqlite3 (linux packages)
$ sudo apt-get install xclip libsqlite3

You also need a version of Ruby installed that includes the OpenSSL libraries.  Refer to http://www.ruby-lang.org for help in installing Ruby.


* Installation *
First, using Git, clone the repository:
$ git clone git@github.com:jamesds/pass_crypt.git

There is a one-line install script that simply puts a symbolic link in your /usr/bin directory pointing to the pass_crypt.rb file in the directory the script is run from.  To use it, run the following whilst inside the directory:
$ ./install.sh


* Usage *
Simply run pass_crypt with no parameters to be shown brief usage instructions.

'crypt.db' in the application directory is the SQLite database.  It may be wise to make backups of this file.
